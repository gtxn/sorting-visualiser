# sorting-visualiser
See how sorting algorithms work using this website! Supports bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort. Also has functionality to tweak the number of elements and speed of animation. If it's going too fast or slow, press the speed up and slow down buttons below the animation area :D Built with pure html, bootstrap for formatting, and lots and lots of flex boxes...
